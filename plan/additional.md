features suggestions that align with the app’s primary goal of saving lives when people are outside alone:

### 1. **Automatic Check-In**
   - **Feature**: The app could periodically ask users if they're okay, especially if it detects that they've been stationary for too long in an unusual location (e.g., not at home or work).
   - **Why**: Ensures the app remains proactive in monitoring the user’s safety and can trigger alerts if there's no response.

### 2. **Emergency Contact Auto-Notification**
   - **Feature**: If the user triggers an alert or fails to respond to a check-in, the app automatically notifies designated emergency contacts with the user’s location and status.
   - **Why**: Provides a safety net where friends or family can intervene even if the user can't reach out themselves.

### 3. **Audio & Video Recording on Alert**
   - **Feature**: When an alert is triggered, the app could automatically start recording audio or video and save it to the cloud.
   - **Why**: This could help provide evidence or context to emergency services in case of an incident.

### 4. **Safe Zone Setup**
   - **Feature**: Users can define "safe zones" (e.g., home, work, school). The app would reduce or stop alerts within these zones but be extra vigilant when the user leaves them.
   - **Why**: Helps reduce false alarms and ensures the app focuses on when the user is outside their normal safe environments.

### 5. **"I’m Being Followed" Mode**
   - **Feature**: Users can discreetly activate a mode that sends continuous location updates to emergency contacts or even public safety services while keeping their phone screen locked but active.
   - **Why**: Designed for situations where the user feels threatened but can’t overtly trigger an alarm.

### 6. **Panic Button Widget**
   - **Feature**: A customizable widget for the home screen that allows users to quickly trigger an alert with one tap.
   - **Why**: Provides quick access in case of emergencies where speed is critical.

### 7. **Heartbeat or Fall Detection**
   - **Feature**: If integrated with a smartwatch or phone sensors, the app could detect a rapid drop in heart rate, abnormal patterns, or sudden falls, automatically triggering an alert if it detects something abnormal.
   - **Why**: This would add an additional layer of automated monitoring, especially for people with medical conditions or those at risk.

### 8. **Community Help Network**
   - **Feature**: Users within a certain radius of a triggered alert could receive a notification and offer help, creating a community-based safety network.
   - **Why**: In emergency situations, nearby users might be able to assist faster than emergency services.

### 9. **Battery-Saving Mode**
   - **Feature**: Optimize location tracking and alerts for low battery situations, adjusting the frequency of pings or alerts when the phone is running low on power.
   - **Why**: Ensures the app remains operational for as long as possible when battery life is limited.

### 10. **Route Safety Monitoring**
   - **Feature**: Users could input their intended route (e.g., from home to a friend’s house). The app would monitor if the user deviates significantly from the route and send an alert if something seems off.
   - **Why**: Provides an additional layer of protection for users traveling alone, particularly in unfamiliar or potentially dangerous areas.

### 11. **Public Incident Alerts**
   - **Feature**: Provide real-time alerts about nearby incidents reported by other users or public safety data, such as crimes, accidents, or natural disasters.
   - **Why**: Keeps users informed of dangers around them and allows them to avoid high-risk areas.

### 12. **Silent SOS Mode**
   - **Feature**: Allow users to send a silent alert to emergency services or contacts (e.g., by pressing a combination of volume buttons), without drawing attention to their phone.
   - **Why**: Useful in situations where the user needs help but doesn’t want to alert the person posing a threat.

### 13. **Journey Monitoring**
   - **Feature**: Users can activate journey monitoring before embarking on a trip. If they don’t reach their destination within a set time, the app automatically sends alerts to emergency contacts.
   - **Why**: Provides peace of mind for users traveling alone, particularly in potentially risky situations or unfamiliar areas.

### 14. **AI-Powered Danger Detection**
   - **Feature**: Use AI to analyze patterns in the user’s behavior and environment (e.g., time of day, location, movement speed) and proactively suggest when to activate heightened safety measures or send a notification if something seems off.
   - **Why**: Adds an intelligent layer of protection, predicting potential dangers before they escalate.

### 15. **Weather Alerts**
   - **Feature**: Integrate with local weather data to provide alerts about extreme weather conditions, especially when users are outdoors.
   - **Why**: Protects users from unforeseen natural dangers, such as severe storms, floods, or heatwaves.

These features focus on extending the core safety functions to ensure users are protected in a variety of scenarios, while also enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of the app. Which features stand out to us?
