Organizing our code into a well-defined file structure helps maintain clarity and manageability. Here’s a recommended file structure for a system that involves tracking client locations, handling alerts, and sending notifications:

### Recommended File Structure

```
/client/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── main.rs
    │   ├── location.rs
    │   ├── alert.rs
    │   └── notification.rs
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── README.md

/backend/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── main.rs
    │   ├── location.rs
    │   ├── alert.rs
    │   ├── notification.rs
    │   ├── database.rs
    │   └── utils.rs
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── README.md

/shared/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── models.rs
    │   └── utils.rs
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── README.md
```

### Explanation

#### **Client-Side (e.g., Mobile or Desktop Application)**
- **`/client/src/main.rs`**: Entry point of the client application. It initializes and starts the application.
- **`/client/src/location.rs`**: Contains logic for tracking and sending location data to the backend.
- **`/client/src/alert.rs`**: Handles the logic for triggering alerts and sending them to the backend.
- **`/client/src/notification.rs`**: Manages receiving and displaying notifications from the backend.

- **`Cargo.toml`**: Configuration file for dependencies and build settings specific to the client application.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for setting up and running the client-side application.

#### **Backend (e.g., Server Application)**
- **`/backend/src/main.rs`**: Entry point of the backend application. Initializes and starts the server.
- **`/backend/src/location.rs`**: Manages storing and processing location data from clients.
- **`/backend/src/alert.rs`**: Handles incoming alerts, processes them, and identifies nearby clients.
- **`/backend/src/notification.rs`**: Generates and sends notifications to clients based on alert data.
- **`/backend/src/database.rs`**: Contains database interaction logic (e.g., CRUD operations).
- **`/backend/src/utils.rs`**: Contains utility functions (e.g., distance calculations).

- **`Cargo.toml`**: Configuration file for dependencies and build settings specific to the backend application.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for setting up and running the backend server.

#### **Shared (e.g., Common Data Structures and Utilities)**
- **`/shared/src/models.rs`**: Contains shared data models and structs used by both client and backend.
- **`/shared/src/utils.rs`**: Contains shared utility functions and constants.

- **`Cargo.toml`**: Configuration file for dependencies and build settings specific to the shared library.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the shared library.

### Additional Tips

1. **Use a Shared Library**: If we’re using Rust, the shared library can be published as a crate to be used by both client and backend projects, ensuring consistency in data models and utilities.

2. **Version Control**: Include a `.gitignore` file in each project directory to exclude build artifacts, dependencies, and other non-essential files.

3. **Testing**: Consider adding a `/tests` directory in each project for unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

4. **Documentation**: Maintain documentation in each `README.md` to guide setup, usage, and development processes.

By following this structure, we’ll have a clear separation of concerns between the client and backend, while also making it easy to manage and update shared components. If we have more specific requirements or additional components, we can adjust this structure accordingly.
